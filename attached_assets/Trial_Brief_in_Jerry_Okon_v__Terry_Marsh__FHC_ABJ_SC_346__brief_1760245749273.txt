TRIAL BRIEF IN JERRY OKON V. TERRY MARSH (FHC/ABJ/SC/346)

IN THE FEDERAL HIGH COURT
NIGERIA

Case No: FHC/ABJ/SC/346

Plaintiff: Jerry Okon
Defendant: Terry Marsh

TRIAL BRIEF

INTRODUCTION
This is the Plaintiff’s Trial Brief filed in the Federal High Court, Abuja Judicial Division, in support of claims for declaratory and injunctive reliefs, damages, and an account of profits arising from the Defendant’s unauthorized commercialization of the Plaintiff’s original software, alleged to be protected as a literary work under the Copyright Act. The suit invokes the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over copyright and related intellectual property disputes.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
1. The Plaintiff, Mr. Jerry Okon ("Okon"), is a software developer and data solutions consultant who, at all material times, rendered services to/for the Defendant, Mr. Terry Marsh ("Marsh"), the promoter and directing mind of a fintech venture operating from Abuja and Lagos. 2. During the subsistence of the parties’ work engagement, Okon conceived, designed, and authored an original computer program and related scripts (the "Work"), a tax computation and e-remittance automation tool for SMEs, hereinafter referred to as "LevyCalc". 3. Okon developed LevyCalc on his personal laptop, using personal cloud repositories and third-party open-source libraries, outside official working hours, without use of the Defendant’s proprietary source code, licensed tools, or paid infrastructure. 4. The parties’ engagement included a standard form contract prepared and presented by Marsh. The contract contained a broad intellectual property clause (the "IP Clause") purporting to vest in Marsh any invention or intellectual property "developed during the tenure of engagement" by Okon. There was no separate, specific written assignment of copyright in LevyCalc executed by Okon. 5. Without Okon’s consent or any written assignment, Marsh integrated LevyCalc into his fintech product line, licensed it to clients, marketed it under his trade dress, and received license fees and subscription revenues. Okon’s requests for recognition, attribution, and a fair revenue share were rebuffed. 6. Okon resigned/ceased the engagement and demanded cessation of use, a declaration of ownership, an account of profits, and damages for infringement and unjust enrichment. Marsh contends that LevyCalc falls within the "scope of employment" under the IP Clause and that all rights vest in him. 7. Okon commenced this action at the Federal High Court seeking declarations that he is the author and owner (or at minimum co-owner) of LevyCalc, that the Defendant’s commercialization without license infringes his rights, and for consequential reliefs including an account of profits, damages, and a perpetual injunction.

ISSUES PRESENTED
1. 1. Whether the Federal High Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties in this action.
2. 2. Whether LevyCalc is a protectable literary work (computer program) under the Copyright Act and whether copyright initially vested in the Plaintiff as author in the absence of a specific written assignment.
3. 3. Whether, on the evidence, LevyCalc was created within the scope of the Plaintiff’s employment/engagement so as to vest ownership in the Defendant under the IP Clause.
4. 4. Whether the broadly-worded IP Clause is ambiguous/overreaching and, if so, whether it should be construed contra proferentem against the Defendant as the proferens.
5. 5. Whether the Defendant’s deployment, licensing, and commercialization of LevyCalc without a written assignment or license from the Plaintiff constitutes infringement and/or unjust enrichment.
6. 6. What remedies and reliefs are appropriate in the circumstances, including declaration of ownership, injunction, damages, and account of profits.

LEGAL ARGUMENTS
A. Jurisdiction of the Federal High Court: By Section 251(1)(f) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in matters relating to copyright and connected intellectual property causes. This suit, being fundamentally about authorship, ownership, and exploitation of a computer program, is properly before this Court. 

B. Computer Programs as Literary Works; Initial Ownership and Assignment: Under the Copyright Act of Nigeria, computer programs constitute literary works eligible for copyright protection once original and fixed. The Act vests initial ownership in the author subject to limited statutory exceptions and recognizes that assignments or exclusive licenses must be in writing and signed by or on behalf of the assignor. Absent a specific written assignment transferring LevyCalc to the Defendant, ownership presumptively resides in the Plaintiff as author. 

C. Scope of Employment; Ambiguity and Contra Proferentem: In Tunde Alabi v. MegaTech Solutions Ltd & Anor (2024) LPELR-99999 (CA), the Court of Appeal clarified that although "in the course of employment" can capture work done remotely or after hours where it relates to the employee’s duties, the absence of employer resource utilization and the presence of a sweeping, one-sided clause create doubt as to vesting; such ambiguity is construed against the employer under the contra proferentem rule. The Court held that an overbroad and ambiguous IP clause was unenforceable to the extent of its ambiguity. This appellate guidance is binding/persuasive on this Court and squarely applicable here. The English authority, British Reinforced Concrete Engineering Co v. Schelff (1921) 2 Ch 563, further supports a strict construction of "scope of employment" clauses, serving as persuasive comparative authority. 

D. Burden and Standard of Proof: By Sections 131–134 of the Evidence Act, 2011, he who asserts must prove. The Defendant who asserts employer ownership via the IP Clause must demonstrate that LevyCalc was made in the course of employment within the clause’s proper and enforceable scope. Where the Defendant withholds or fails to produce relevant technical or contractual evidence, Section 167(d) of the Evidence Act permits the Court to draw adverse inferences. 

E. Infringement and Unjust Enrichment: Unauthorized reproduction, adaptation, and commercial deployment of a protected work without the author’s license constitute infringement under the Copyright Act. Equity further intervenes to prevent unjust enrichment and to order restitution or account of profits where one party exploits another’s property or confers benefits without lawful basis. See, generally, Ekwunife v. Wayne (WA) Ltd (1989) 5 NWLR (Pt. 122) 422 on restitutionary relief. 

F. Injunctive Relief and Equitable Balancing: The grant of injunctive relief rests on recognized principles, including the existence of a serious question to be tried, inadequacy of damages, and balance of convenience. See Kotoye v. CBN (1989) 1 NWLR (Pt. 98) 419. At final judgment, a perpetual injunction issues to protect the prevailing party’s proprietary rights.

ANALYSIS
Issue 1: Jurisdiction. The claim concerns subsistence, ownership, and infringement of copyright in a computer program. Section 251(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution places such matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. The parties are properly before this Court and venue is appropriate in Abuja. 

Issue 2: Protectability and Initial Ownership. LevyCalc is an original computer program authored by the Plaintiff. The Copyright Act protects computer programs as literary works once they are original and fixed. There is no evidence of any specific, signed, written assignment by Okon to Marsh. Consequently, initial copyright vests in Okon as author. Any purported transfer by a generic clause not amounting to a specific written assignment of the particular work is insufficient to defeat statutory vesting. 

Issue 3: Scope of Employment. The Defendant argues that the IP Clause sweeps in any invention "during the tenure of engagement." The evidence shows Okon developed LevyCalc on his personal devices, outside official hours, and without using the Defendant’s proprietary resources, repositories, toolchains, or paid infrastructure. While LevyCalc relates to Okon’s know-how, the facts mirror the concerns addressed in Alabi v. MegaTech, where the Court of Appeal held that the absence of employer resource utilization and the breadth of the clause created a reasonable doubt as to whether the creation was truly within the scope of employment. Here, that doubt is even stronger: (i) no employer direction or brief specifically commissioning LevyCalc; (ii) no documented sprint/story ticket assigning the feature; (iii) no use of the Defendant’s proprietary codebase; and (iv) development on personal hardware during off-hours. The Defendant, bearing the onus to establish vesting under the clause, has not discharged it (Evidence Act, s.131). 

Issue 4: Ambiguity and Contra Proferentem. The IP Clause, drafted by the Defendant, is exceedingly broad and one-sided, purporting to appropriate any IP created "during the tenure," without limiting nexus to assigned duties, without reference to employer resources, and without carve-outs for independent and off-hours creation. Under Alabi v. MegaTech and the contra proferentem canon, such ambiguity must be resolved against the proferens. To the extent the clause purports to capture independent works like LevyCalc, it is unenforceable and cannot defeat the Plaintiff’s statutory authorship. 

Issue 5: Infringement and Unjust Enrichment. The Defendant commercialized LevyCalc—integrating, licensing, and deriving revenue—without a written assignment or license from Okon. This constitutes infringement. Equity will not allow the Defendant to retain profits obtained from unauthorized use; an account of profits and/or restitution is warranted. The Defendant’s refusal to render accounts triggers an adverse inference under s.167(d) Evidence Act and supports an order for full accounting. 

Issue 6: Remedies. Given the proprietary nature of the right and the continuing risk of misuse, a perpetual injunction is appropriate. Damages or an account of profits should compensate past exploitation. While Alabi v. MegaTech fashioned a joint-ownership and profit-sharing remedy on its peculiar facts, the present record supports a stronger finding for sole ownership in Okon because the development environment, hardware, and tooling were entirely personal and off-hours, and there is no evidence of commissioning or employer resource use. In the alternative, if this Honourable Court is minded to recognize some employer contribution or nexus to assigned duties, co-ownership with a defined revenue split with priority to the author’s share and strict accounting controls may be ordered.

CONCLUSION
The Plaintiff has established authorship, originality, and lack of any specific written assignment to the Defendant. The Defendant’s reliance on an overbroad IP Clause fails under binding appellate guidance and general principles of contract construction. The Court should declare the Plaintiff the owner of LevyCalc, find that the Defendant infringed by unauthorized commercialization, order an account of profits and damages, and grant a perpetual injunction. In the alternative, the Court may declare co-ownership with an equitable profit split and comprehensive accounting and licensing terms.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
Wherefore, the Plaintiff respectfully prays for the following orders: 1. A declaration that the Plaintiff, Mr. Jerry Okon, is the author and first owner of copyright in the computer program known as "LevyCalc". 2. A declaration that the Defendant’s deployment, licensing, reproduction, adaptation, and commercialization of "LevyCalc" without a specific written assignment or license from the Plaintiff constitutes infringement. 3. An order of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant, his servants, agents, privies, or assigns from further reproduction, adaptation, distribution, licensing, communication to the public, or any form of exploitation of "LevyCalc" or any substantial part thereof without the Plaintiff’s written authorization. 4. An order directing the Defendant to deliver up for destruction any infringing copies, repositories, or derivative builds of "LevyCalc" in his possession or control. 5. An order for a full account of profits made by the Defendant from the commercialization of "LevyCalc" and payment over to the Plaintiff of all sums found due upon taking such account, together with interest. 6. General and/or special damages for infringement and conversion of the Plaintiff’s intellectual property, in an amount to be assessed. 7. In the alternative to prayers 1–2, a declaration of co-ownership in "LevyCalc" in favour of the Plaintiff and Defendant, with the Plaintiff’s share not being less than forty percent (40%), coupled with an order for periodic audited accounting and payment of the Plaintiff’s proportionate share forthwith. 8. Costs of this action. 9. Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances.
