Build a mobile-first modern and interactive MCQ quiz web app using React + Supabase + Zustand + TanStack Query. The name of the app is Easyread IQ
The app should be optimized for performance, state simplicity, and user engagement.
It should include both user and admin interfaces, WhatsApp/SMS authentication via Twilio, and a flexible payment system for quiz access.

⚙️ Architecture

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Zustand (for UI & auth states)

Data fetching & caching: TanStack Query

Backend: Supabase (database, auth, and storage). Database URL will be provided

Auth provider: Twilio (for OTP via WhatsApp with fallback to SMS. If a user is verified by OTP, enable them to login without OTP for 4 weeks before requiring OTP. On the OTP request/Signup, add a login option for verified users to login without OTP

Payments: Supabase functions or Paystack (for one-time payment)

🔐 Auth Flow (Twilio + Supabase)

Registration Flow:

User enters phone number.

Supabase backend calls a serverless function that triggers Twilio API:

// send OTP via WhatsApp first
client.messages.create({
  from: 'whatsapp:+14155238886',
  to: `whatsapp:${phone}`,
  body: 'Your verification code is 123456',
}).catch(() => {
  // fallback to SMS if WhatsApp fails
  client.messages.create({
    from: '+1234567890',
    to: phone,
    body: 'Your verification code is 123456',
  });
});


User inputs OTP → verified via Supabase function.

On success, session stored and Zustand updates user state.

Verification UI:

Simple two-step modal:

Step 1: Enter phone number → show “Sending via WhatsApp…”

Step 2: Enter OTP → verify button.

If OTP expires, allow “Resend via SMS”.

💡 Extra Features

Leaderboard (top scorers)

Quiz retry history

Offline caching of last attempted quiz (for low-network users)

Mobile-first responsive design

🧠 Developer Notes

Use React Suspense + TanStack Query for async states (avoid infinite loops).

Zustand store handles UI, auth, and user session states.

Supabase handles data & auth persistence.

Modular file structure:

src/
 ├─ components/
 ├─ pages/
 ├─ hooks/
 ├─ store/
 ├─ utils/
 ├─ services/ (Supabase + Twilio + Paystack)


Use optimistic updates where possible for a snappy experience.
